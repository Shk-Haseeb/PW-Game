The PW-Game is a simple Python project designed to create strong and secure passwords based on user preferences. It lets you decide how many letters, symbols, and numbers you want in your password and generates a randomized combination to meet those criteria. This ensures your passwords are unique, robust and your online security is strong.

The script works by first asking for your input on the desired number of letters, symbols, and numbers. It then randomly selects characters from predefined lists and combines them into a password. Finally, the order of characters is shuffled for added randomness, and the completed password is displayed. Itâ€™s easy to use, customizable, and perfect for learning Python basics while securing your digital accounts!

Cheers!
